# NewWaveMusicPlayer
Music Player design to play music from anywhere.

This application is focused on allowing you to play any song.
It first allows you to search your computer for any tracks you may own, and if you don't have the track, you can use a youtube link to play it.

As an early build, it lacks features like building a library that persists between launches. It also cannot grab the audio from the video file downloaded via youtube, and instead plays the video outright. I'm working on getting this figured out.

This is my first forray into writing C# applications, and I'm looking forward to the rest of my journey with it.
